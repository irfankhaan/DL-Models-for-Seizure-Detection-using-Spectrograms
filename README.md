## Deep Learning Models for Seizure Detection using Spectrograms

This repositories contains a series of notebooks for binary classification of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals in the Temple University Hospital (TUH) EEG dataset. 
The EEG signals are first converted into spectrogram images and deep learning models are then used to classify these images.

The dataset is publicly available [here](https://isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml).

This is a work in-progress and the repository will be updated.
